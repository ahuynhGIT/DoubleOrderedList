###### DoublyLinkedList

The purpose of this program is to create a double ordered list consisting of Strings (animals) and integers (amounts). With this program, the double ordered list will include Nodes that are sorted by their contents. The strings are ordered alphabetically while the integers are ordered numerically. The lists are then printed accordingly.
